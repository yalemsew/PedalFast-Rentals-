BikeRentHub - Bike Renting Application  

Project Overview  
BikeRentHub is a web-based application designed to facilitate bike rentals in an easy and efficient manner. The platform provides a seamless user experience for browsing available bikes, making reservations, and managing rental history. Users can sign up, log in, and securely rent bikes through an intuitive interface. The system ensures real-time availability updates and smooth transactions.  

The application consists of a frontend built with Angular and a backend developed using Node.js with Express.js. The backend communicates with a database to manage user data, bike inventory, and rental transactions. Authentication and authorization are implemented to secure the platform, ensuring that only registered users can rent bikes.
